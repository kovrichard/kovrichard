# Hello there, I'm Richard. 👋

## Full-stack developer and IT security trainer.

### My side projects are below: 👇

- 🔳 A [website](https://qrkodgenerator.com/en/) to generate QR codes.
<!-- - A [website]() to remove passwords from PDFs. -->
<!-- A [website](https://www.yournextcv.com) to create your own CV. -->
- 🏭 And finally, a fun project: [Shitcoin Factory](https://www.shitcoinfactory.com)
  + For the record, I am a fan of Web3
  + But sadly, there are a lot of useless tokens and projects out there
  + This website is just a joke
  + Also, it aims to show, how easy it is to create a custom token

### Also, I blog about tech stuff and my journey regularly on Twitter ✍️
